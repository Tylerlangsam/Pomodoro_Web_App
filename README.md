# Pomodoro Web App

## Overview

The Pomodoro Web App is a simple productivity tool built using React.js. It allows users to manage their work and break sessions using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. With this app, you can customize your work and break times, start and pause the timer, and receive an alert sound when the timer reaches zero.


## Features

- **Customizable Timer Settings:** You can set your preferred work and break times.
- **Start, Pause, and Reset:** Control the timer with easy-to-use buttons.
- **Automatic Work/Break Switch:** The app automatically switches between work and break periods.
- **Alert Sound:** You'll hear an alert sound when the timer reaches zero.
- **Real-time Updates:** Any changes you make to the timer settings or code are reflected in real-time.

## Usage

To use the Pomodoro Web App effectively, follow these steps:

1. Customize the work and break times using the input fields.

2. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. The timer will start counting down from the work time you've set.

3. If you need to pause the timer, click the "Pause" button. This will temporarily stop the timer.

4. The timer will automatically switch between work and break periods. When the work period is over, it will automatically transition to the break period and vice versa.

5. When the timer reaches zero, an alert sound will play to notify you that it's time to switch between work and break periods. You can adjust the alert sound by providing your preferred audio file.

6. If you wish to start a new work session or reset the timer for any reason, simply click the "Reset" button. This will reset the timer to the initial work time you've set.

The Pomodoro Web App is designed to help you manage your work and break sessions efficiently, enabling you to stay productive and maintain a healthy work routine. Enjoy your focused work sessions!
